# Discord-Member-Botter
This is a Discord Member Botter written in Python
It uses an externel hcaptcha-solver for solving. A free account is already in the config so you may directly start botting.

Make sure you have Python installed and all libraries that are needed.
With good proxies you can go up to 30 accounts/min.

Feel free to open an issue if you need help.
